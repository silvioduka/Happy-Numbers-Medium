Happy Numbers - Medium - from Coding Challenges by Silvio Duka


Last modified date: 2018-03-12

If the repeated sum of squares of the digits of a number is equal to 1, it is considered to be happy. 

For Example: 

23 is a happy number, as: 

2 ^ 2 + 3 ^ 2 = 13 

1 ^ 2 + 3 ^ 2 = 10 

1 ^ 2 + 0 ^ 2 = 1 

Sequence of happy numbers: 1, 7, 10, 13, 19, 23, ... 

Tasks: 

(Easy) Write a program to verify whether a given number is happy or not. 

(Medium) Write a program to find all the happy numbers in a range. 

(Hard) Given a number, write a program to verify whether it's happy or not and to display every sum of squares operation performed till the result is obtained.
